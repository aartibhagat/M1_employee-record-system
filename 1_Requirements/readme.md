Personnel or human resource management refers to the management, both individually and collectively, of an organization’s most valuable resource, the people it employs. The goal of human resource management is to attract and retain a workforce that will enable the organization to achieve its purpose and objectives. Human resource management also involves the training and development, health and welfare and performance improvement of each employee. In addition, it supports the organization’s capacity to plan, monitor and evaluate its own performance. 
It follows that the creation and control of personnel records are critical to the success of an organization’s operations. The effective management of personnel records enables organizations to manage their employees efficiently and equitably, encourages informed and consistent decision making, supports transparency and accountability and facilitates the monitoring and evaluation of staff performance.
